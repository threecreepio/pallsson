# Pallsson SMB1 Practise ROM

This is a small patch to the fantastic Pellsson practice rom (https://github.com/pellsson/smb) allowing PAL version practice rather than NTSC.

Note that this **only** updates the SMB1 version. Lost Levels and Scenarios are left untouched, and will run slow if you attempt to play them on a PAL system.

Probably still has bugs left to iron out.
